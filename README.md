## 🔨 Features

- `Feature 1`: Replica of the Instagram web interface optimized for responsiveness on computers, tablets, and smartphones.
- `Tablet Feature`: When adjusting to the tablet size, the sidebar is removed from the screen due to limited space, and the arrow for navigating through stories is hidden, allowing scrolling to view more content.
- `Smartphone Feature`: When adapting to the smartphone size, the header streamlines its functions to essentials, transferring the others to the footer. Additionally, screen margins are removed to ensure content occupies the entire space without wastage.
